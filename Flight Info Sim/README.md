# Flight Info Widget

### Overview
---

This project is a simple widget that displays fake flight information. I built it to practice HTML and CSS, and to learn JavaScript. 

I hope to implement another version of this project using React and REST APIs, using real flight data.

### Usage

Download all files and open index.html in your browser. You can do this by opening a git terminal in the folder and typing 'open index html' or by dragging the index.html file into your browser.
